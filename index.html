        <h1> Iterative Design </h1>
        <p style="padding-left: 5rem; padding-right: 5rem;"> A key factor in the creation of a successful design is feedback and iteration. Through group
            design sessions, peer critique, and user testing, designers can ensure that their work is
            effective, clear, and accessible. Through a series of revisions made after each stage of
            feedback, our 4 person student group created a website designed to solve a problem and fill
            a niche identified by a startup launched through Y-Combinator, Float Health.

            <h2> Sketching and Wireframing </h2>
            <p>
            Each member of the design team created a unique sketch consisting of a couple of
            screens which showed the base functionality of the website in unique styles and
            layouts.
            </p>
    
        <!--PREDESIGN-->
            <h3> Pre-Design Thinking </h3>
            <p> We chose to design a webpage for the startup Float Health, which aims to be an
                Uber-like website where users can request a nurse to come to their home. When
                thinking about what kind of interface to design, we primarily thought about
                the probable users for this startup. Since people who would need a nurse to
                come to their home are probably older, we decided a desktop webpage would be a better
                design choice, rather than a mobile site. </p>
            <h3> Sketching </h3>
            <p> We first started brainstorming about the various ways the website could look. The
                following 4 designs are quick sketches of a Float Health website.</p>
            <h4> Design 1 </h4>
            <div class="sketch_row">
                <img src="images/sketch_1_page_1.jpg" class="sketch">
                <img src="images/sketch_1_page_2.jpg" class="sketch">
                <img src="images/sketch_1_page_3.jpg" class="sketch">
            </div>
            <p class="sketch_text"> This design features a home screen, profile screen, and a checkout screen.
                The profile screen provides basic information about the website and allows users to
                login. The profile screen is linked to the patient and contains information like lab
                results and the option to schedule an appointment. The checkout screen is a confirmation
                page for when a patient schedules an appointment. </p>
            
            <h4> Design 2 </h4>
            <div class="sketch_row">
                <img src="images/sketch_2_page_1.jpg" class="sketch">
                <img src="images/sketch_2_page_2.jpg" class="sketch">
                <img src="images/sketch_2_page_3.jpg" class="sketch">
            </div>
            <p class="sketch_text"> This design has a home screen, an information form, and a screen for selecting appointment
                search
                results. The home screen provides basic information about the website. The information form has
                the user input their information like address, insurance, and health needs, so they can find a
                nurse who would be best for them. Finally the search result page shows the patient nurses who
                are nearby and match their needs. The patient can select the nurse they prefer and request an appointment.</p>
            <h4> Design 3 </h4>
            <div class="sketch_row">
                <img src="images/sketch_3_page_1.jpg" class="sketch">
                <img src="images/sketch_3_page_2.jpg" class="sketch">
                <img src="images/sketch_3_page_3.jpg" class="sketch">
            </div>
            <p class="sketch_text"> This design has a patient profile containing basic patient information, a home screen, and an
                appointment
                scheduling page. The home page has information about Float Health and allows the patient to select "Schedule Nurse's
                Visit".
                This page also has a live chat option for assistance.
                The scheduling page has an interactive calendar so the patient can choose which day they would like to schedule
                their
                appointment.</p>
            <h4> Design 4 </h4>
            <div class="sketch_row">
                <img src="images/sketch_4_page_1.jpg" class="sketch">
                <img src="images/sketch_4_page_2.jpg" class="sketch">
                <img src="images/sketch_4_page_3.jpg" class="sketch">
                <img src="images/sketch_4_page_4.jpg" class="sketch">
            </div>
            <p class="sketch_text"> This design has a patient profile page, a nurse sign up page, a nurse profile page, and a
                patient scheduling page.
                Unlike the other designs, this design integrates two sides of functionality: those on the patient side and those on
                the
                nurse side. Nurses are able to apply to be on the website and have their own profile page they can edit. </p>


        <!--WIREFRAMES-->
            <br>
            <h2> Wireframes </h2>
            <p> Next, we created a low-fidelity wireframe which merged our ideas together. This wireframe has a home screen, nurse
            and patient information / signup forms, nurse and patient profiles, a page for booking appointments, and an appointment
            confirmation page. While designing this wireframe, we pulled ideas from each of our sketches. From design 3, we pulled
            the live chat option, from design 1 we pulled the confirmation page, from design 2 we pulled the information forms, and
            from design 4 we pulled the nurse side of the interface, for example.</p>

        <h1> Mockups </h1>
        <h2> High Fidelity Mockup </h2>
        <p> Based on our low-fidelity wireframe, we created an interactive high-fidelity prototype. This prototype incorporated
        new characteristics for the page like a color scheme and a well-defined font hierarchy. We created a logo for the website
        and connected the various pages so that a user could navigate through them. </p>

        <h2> Studio Critique </h2>
        <p> At this point in our development process, we spent a lot of time creating prototypes for our
        website, and as such, are likely to be prone to confirmation bias. In a studio setting, we had
        people who were unfamiliar with the website interact it and critique our work. We took notes on
        the issues posed and compiled them below:</p>

        <h2> User Testing Analysis and Results </h2>
        <p> The task we gave the UserTesting participants was to login to our site, try to book an appointment, and to confirm the appointment.  The results with respect to the users completing our task were as expected and were 100% successful in terms of task completion.  The main task was to make an appointment and the subtasks were to login, book an appointment, and confirm it.  The only error that was recorded was that one of the users mistakenly clicked the "I am a Patient" button which took them to their patient profile page and so they had to click logout in order to get back to the homepage and eventually click the 'login' button to successfully complete the task.  In general, all three users did a wonderful job on the task. <br> <br>

            Regarding the changes we would to our potential interface based on our UserTesting results and feedback include the following: centering the 'Book an Appointment' subtitle on the appointment page, adding availability to the patient-facing calendar shown on our 'book an appointment page', renaming the "I am a Patient" button to "Patient Sign Up", removing the profile picture and the update profile picture button, making it overtly obvious on the homepage that our service is sending nurses to people through appointment booking (Uber for Nurses), changing the submit button functionality to take the user to their profile page instead of the homepage, and finally we would clarify the background coloration and highlighting of the appointment needs options on the 'Book an Appointment' by deleting it wholesale.
